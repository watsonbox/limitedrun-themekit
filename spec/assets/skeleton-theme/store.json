        "description": "<p>Internationally acclaimed American concert pianist Eliane Lust was raised in Belgium, where she began playing piano at age 5. As a girl, she performed the music of Darius Milhaud for the composer; it was Milhaud who suggested that she should go into music professionally. Through her principle teachers, Leonard Shure and György Sebök, she is tied directly to the great classical German and Hungarian musical traditions of Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Liszt. She has collaborated with many contemporary composers, including John Cage, Leon Kirchner and Frederic Rzewski.</p>",

They have been performed on a variety of instruments, including the traditional Japanese koto and shō, in both solo and ensemble settings, but until now, no solo piano recording has been available outside Japan.</p><p>This set, featuring the \"unabashedly gorgeous\" The Olive Branch Speaks, commissioned by the pianist for her A Sweeter Music project, is lavishly packaged and is accompanied by essays from both the composer and performer.</p><p>Patterns of Plants is now available for preorder.</p>"
